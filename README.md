# AI-Based Smart Waste Segregation Awareness Assistant

## Overview
This project compares two intelligent approaches for text-based waste segregation:
- Rule-Based Semantic Classification
- TF-IDF + Naive Bayes Machine Learning

Waste items are classified into Wet Waste, Dry Waste, and E-Waste.

## Dataset
- Manually curated textual dataset
- 25 samples
- Household and campus waste items

## Methods
- Rule-Based keyword matching
- Machine Learning using TF-IDF + Naive Bayes

## Results
| Method | Accuracy |
|------|---------|
| Rule-Based | 100% |
| ML-Based | 62.5% |

Rule-based works well in controlled datasets, while ML shows better generalization.

## Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, LaTeX (IEEE), GitHub

## Sustainability Impact
Supports waste segregation awareness and sustainable waste management.
